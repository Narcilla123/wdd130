        <p>My degree is on CS or "Computer Science"</p>
        <p>My Hobbies include playing sports, cooking food, and making memories with friends and family</p>
        <p>An advantage for taking this course would be the basic knowledge on how the structure of every website is made. This class will also help me further my knowledge for my future career </p>
        <P>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for about 11 years and one of my favorite scriptures is from D&C 109:16</P>
